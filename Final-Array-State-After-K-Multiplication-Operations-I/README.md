**Basic Idea**

The goal is to modify an integer array by performing k operations, where in each operation, the smallest element in the array is multiplied by a given multiplier. Since we work on the smallest value,use linear search to find min eleement in the array and replace it.

**Approach**

1. Use a dynamically allocated array (result) to store the final state of the input array after the operations.
   >This allows the original array to remain unmodified, and the caller manages the memory.

2. Copy the elements of the input array (nums) into the newly allocated result array.
Perform k operations:
>i) In each operation, find the smallest value in the result array and its corresponding index.

>ii) Multiply the smallest value by the multiplier.

>iii) Decrement the operation counter k.

3.Once all k operations are complete, set the returnSize to the size of the array (numsSize) and return the updated array.
